# Model validation using deep generation of stress data
A tutorial at the ACM conference on Economics and Computation 2023 

### Description
The tutorial is aimed to present a novel procedure for model robustness validation. The key idea is to apply deep generative models that can sample unlikely events and introduce slight shifts in input data. Such an approach allows us to examine models’ reactions to input data with different levels of the likelihood. The growing number of running models highlights the importance of model validation, which determines the process of verifying the validity of input and output data, model’s performance, stability, and interpretability.

### Target audience and prerequisite knowledge
The target audience is risk managers and researchers who are interested in applying deep generative models for evaluating the model robustness. We assume the audience has basic knowledge in machine learning, probability theory, statistics and python programming.
